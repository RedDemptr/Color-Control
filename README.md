# Cube Control

Initial project description from some time ago:

A PvP map where there is a 5x5 grid of 5x5 cubes floating in the void. The cubes are separated by 10 blocks, and the edges are black wool (thus not playing into the core game mechanic). Teams spawn on the cubes on opposite corners of this grid, and every side of their cube is made of wool of their team color. This cannot be changed at any point during the game. The adjacent cubes to either side - not diagonally - will also be the team's color. Any other cubes can be captured, as detailed below.

At the beginning of the match, each cube will be made of white wool. When a player breaks a wool block, it changes to the color of his team. When a side of a cube is either fully blue or fully red, it is considered "captured" and will spawn items that only the capturing team can pick up. These items can include blocks for bridging, crafting materials, and arrows/potions. If a side is partially red and partially blue, it will not spawn items (nor will white sides).

Every 60 seconds, all 25 cubes will rotate 90 degrees. Captured blocks which were formerly on top of the cube remain captured, though items will not spawn on captured sides unless they are on the top side of a cube. Cubes will always rotate to each of their sides in the same order.

The games is 12 minutes long by default, meaning that each side is on top twice during the game. As an aside (hah!), wool blocks can be captured even when not on top if a player crouches on the edge and breaks them, though the player will naturally become easy pickings for the opposing side.

The game is won by having more points than the opposing team. Points are earned in the following ways:
Having a full side of a cube captured: 1 point per minute, and 3 at the end of the game.
Killing an opposing player: 1 point

Additionally, each side of the central cube is worth twice as many points both during and at the end of the game.(edited)
Players start the game with only Sharp. I/Knockback I shears. For weapons, they must collect resources spawned as items from captured sides and bring them to the crafting table at their base cube.
Perhaps killing a player would upgrade your shears, but the upgrades are reset upon death.(edited)

You can't place blocks on the white/colored wool, but black wool is fair game. Those blocks may fall off into the void when the cube rotates, though.
Items won't spawn if an item is still on the spawn location. That means that a player has to be actively collecting the items for them to accumulate.
The two cubes adjacent to the team spawns will start off with brides to the spawn cube. One of them will spawn cobblestone, and one will spawn wood planks.

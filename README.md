## Color Control
Color Control is a fast-paced game of territory control. Players will collect resources for their team by capturing a grid of cubes and protecting them from enemies, and can then use those resources to create equipment and structures to help them take down the opposing team. Every few minutes, however, the cubes will rotate. The game is won by having the most points at the end of the game, but Color Control is completely configurable, allowing you to tweak the game to your tastes.

## Gameplay
A game of Color Control is won by capturing floating cubes for your team. Once a cube is captured, it will spawn resources for your team - iron, diamonds, and blocks, to name a few - and will also accumulate points for your team over time. This is done very intuitively using Minecraft's core mechanic; breaking blocks! Every time you break a concrete block, it will be captured for your team, bringing you that much closer to victory. Remember to stay on your toes - at intervals throughout the match, the cubes will rotate on their axis! Recapturing cubes as quickly as possible will help you win the match; and don't forget to stop your opponents from doing the same!

## Gamemodes
Color Control boasts three distinct gamemodes; **Classic**, which is won by earning points from captured cubes; **Deathmatch**, which can be won only by killing opponents and keeping your own team alive; and **Entropy**, a chaotic gamemode in which the battlefield will fall apart under your feet as you play. Players can use the settings menu in the lobby to tweak the game to their own tastes. Each mode plays differently, so be sure to try them all!

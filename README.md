## Color Control
Color Control is a fast-paced game of territory control. Players will collect resources for their team by capturing a grid of cubes and protecting them from enemies, and can then use those resources to create equipment and structures to help them take down the opposing team. Every few minutes, however, the cubes will rotate. The game is won by having the most points at the end of the game, but Color Control is completely configurable, allowing you to tweak the game to your tastes.

This project was partway through development when functions were released, and as such is a hybrid of formats.

.mcc files in this repo are made to be compiled with Smelt by Gnasp, which you can find at smelt.gnasp.com.

.mcfunction files run natively in Minecraft, and should be placed in /world/data/functions/
